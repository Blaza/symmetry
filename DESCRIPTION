Description: Implementations a large number of tests for symmetry
    (and their bootstrap variants), which can be used to test the symmetry of IID
    samples or of model residuals. Currently, the supported models are linear models
    and GARCH models (fitted with the fGarch package). The tests are implemented
    using Rcpp which ensures great performance.

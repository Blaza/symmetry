Description: Implementations of a large number of tests for symmetry
    and their bootstrap variants, which can be used for testing the symmetry of IID
    samples around a known or unknown mean. Functions are also there for testing
    the symmetry of model residuals around zero. Currently, the supported models
    are linear models and GARCH models (fitted with the fGarch package). The tests
    are implemented using Rcpp which ensures great performance.
